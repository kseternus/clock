This program is a simple digital clock built using Python's Tkinter library for graphical user interfaces.<br />
It displays the current time in a window, updating every 100 milliseconds to reflect the current hour, minute, and second.<br />
The clock is styled with a bold font and a colored background, and the time is shown in the format HH:MM:SS.<br />
The code is modular, organized into a DigitalClock class, and uses the __main__ block to ensure it only runs when executed directly.<br />
